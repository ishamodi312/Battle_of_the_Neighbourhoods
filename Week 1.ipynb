If all the amenities are present in a short enough radius, the person may accept a slightly higher rent. On the other hand, if there are no services nearby, they will have a hard time choosing the house.\n \nThis project focuses on bringing objectivity in decision making process of rental search through developing a convenience and affordability matrix for the house seekers."

Rent will undergo a similar transformation.\n \nThe normalized values can then be used to calculate a cost-effectiveness score."
